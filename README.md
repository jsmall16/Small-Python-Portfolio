## Purpose

This repository showcases programming skills I developed as a student at the University of Notre Dame.


The purpose of this repository is to highlight my ability to:

   - Create advanced data visualizations to communicate insights
   - Use data wrangling techniques to clean and transform untidy datasets
   - Work with intermediate data structures
   - Query databases to extract meaningful information
   - Apply text and image processing techniques for enhanced data analysis
   - Train basic machine learning models 


## Structure

This repository is organized into the following folders: 

   - Data visualizations
   - Data Wrangling
   - Key Data Structures
   - Databases
   - Databases & Data Processing
   - Text Processing
   - Image Processing
   - Machine Learning

The organization of these folders enables clear navigation and demonstration of my data science skills.
