# üèÖ 2008 Olympic Medalists: Data Analysis üèÖ

**Insert graph**

**TLDR**: An in-depth analysis of the 2008 Olympic medalists, focusing on data cleaning, organization, aggregation, and visualization to uncover key insights about medal distribution across sports and genders.

**Description**: The 2008 Summer Olympics showcased the world's best athletes competing across various sports for gold, silver, and bronze medals. This project involves tidying and analyzing the dataset to extract meaningful insights, such as the most medal-heavy sports, gender-based medal distribution, and the dominance of certain events. The data was first cleaned and transformed into a tidy format, enabling further aggregation and visualization to identify key trends in Olympic medal distribution.

**Skills**: This project involved data cleaning and wrangling, including handling missing values, restructuring wide-format data, and ensuring consistency. Using Pandas and NumPy, I performed data manipulation, aggregation, and exploratory analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilized for data visualization, highlighting key patterns in medal distribution. Additionally, data reshaping techniques were applied to convert wide-format data into a long-format, making it more suitable for analysis.

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in uncovering meaningful patterns in sports performance, contributing to a deeper understanding of Olympic history.
