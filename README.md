# Small-Python-Portfolio

## Purpose

This repository showcases programming skills I developed as a student at the University of Notre Dame in my Elements of Computing II course.


The purpose of this repository is to highlight my ability to:

   - Create advanced data visualizations to communicate insights
   - Use data wrangling techniques to clean and transform untidy datasets
   - Work with intermediate data structures
   - Query databases to extract meaningful information
   - Apply text and image processing techniques for enhanced data analysis
   - Train basic machine learning models

### üêß Penguins App: Interactive Data Exploration üêß

![Penguins](basic%20streamlit%20app/Penguins1.png)

**TLDR**: An interactive, Streamlit web app that allows users to explore and filter a dataset of penguins, providing an intuitive way to analyze different species and their characteristics.

**Description**: The Penguins App is a user-friendly tool that displays a dataset of penguins and allows users to filter by species for a more focused analysis. Upon launching, the app initially presents the entire dataset, giving users a broad overview. With a simple dropdown menu, users can select a species, and the dataset dynamically updates to display only the relevant rows. This makes it easy to explore, compare, and analyze the different penguin species efficiently. 

**Skills**: This project involved building an interactive web application with Streamlit, integrating data manipulation techniques using Pandas, and ensuring a smooth user experience with dynamic filtering. Additionally, basic Python scripting was used to structure the app, enabling user-driven updates and selections.

This project complements my overall portfolio by showcasing my ability to integrate data analysis with interactive web applications. It goes beyond traditional data wrangling and visualization by allowing users to dynamically explore and filter datasets. This highlights my ability to create practical, interactive tools that make data exploration more accessible.

### üèÖ 2008 Olympic Medalists: Data Analysis üèÖ

![Olympics Graph](TidyData-Project/Sport%20Medal%20Count.png)

**TLDR**: An in-depth analysis of the 2008 Olympic medalists, focusing on data cleaning, organization, aggregation, and visualization to uncover key insights about medal distribution across sports and genders.

**Description**: The 2008 Summer Olympics showcased the world's best athletes competing across various sports for gold, silver, and bronze medals. This project involves tidying and analyzing the dataset to extract meaningful insights, such as the most medal-heavy sports, gender-based medal distribution, and the dominance of certain events. The data was first cleaned and transformed into a tidy format, enabling further aggregation and visualization to identify key trends in Olympic medal distribution.

**Skills**: This project involved data cleaning and wrangling, including handling missing values, restructuring wide-format data, and ensuring consistency. Using Pandas, I performed data manipulation, aggregation, and exploratory analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilized for data visualization, highlighting key patterns in medal distribution. 

This project complements my overall portfolio by demonstrating my ability to clean, transform, and analyze complex datasets. It showcases my expertise in data wrangling, aggregation, and visualization to uncover meaningful insights. This highlights my ability to apply analytical techniques to real-world data and effectively communicate findings.

### üé§ Taylor Swift's Lyrical Legacy: Custom NER + Visual Insights üé§

![TSWIFT](NERStreamlitApp/TSNERIMAGE.jpeg)

**TLDR:** An interactive Streamlit app that uses NLP and data visualization to explore Taylor Swift‚Äôs lyrics. Fans can upload lyrics, define custom entity patterns with spaCy‚Äôs EntityRuler, and analyze word counts across albums to uncover trends in her storytelling.

**Description:** Taylor Swift‚Äôs lyrics have captivated fans for over two decades, evolving across genres and emotional themes. This project combines custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) with lyrical data analysis to offer a deeper look at her discography. Using spaCy, users can define their own entities and highlight them in her lyrics. Additionally, album word counts are visualized to track the evolution of her writing style. The app enables both fans and data enthusiasts to interactively explore Taylor Swift‚Äôs lyrical legacy through natural language processing and data storytelling.

**Skills:** This project highlights my skills in NLP (spaCy), Streamlit app development, and data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. The app integrates multiple Python libraries into a user-friendly tool that reveals trends across Taylor Swift's albums and lyrics.

This project complements my broader coding portfolio by showcasing my ability to combine technical skills in NLP, app development, and data storytelling. It blends natural language processing with data anlaysis, demonstrating my ability to apply analytical techniques in engaging ways.
