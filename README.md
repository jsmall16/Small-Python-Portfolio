## At a Glance

### üêß Penguins App: Interactive Data Exploration üêß

![Penguins](basic%20streamlit%20app/Penguins1.png)

**TLDR**: An interactive, Streamlit web app that allows users to explore, filter, and visualize a dataset of penguins, providing an intuitive way to analyze different species and their characteristics.

**Description**: The Penguins App is a user-friendly tool that displays a dataset of penguins and allows users to filter by species and island for a more focused analysis. Upon launching, the app initially presents the entire dataset, giving users a broad overview. With a simple dropdown menu, users can select a species and island, and the dataset dynamically updates to display only the relevant rows. This makes it easy to explore, compare, and analyze the different penguin species efficiently. Users can then view summary statistics pertaining to these filtered rows based on users' selections. Finally, to visualize the distribution of species, users can see a bar graph that breaks down the count of the different species present in the dataset. 

**Skills**: This project involved building an interactive app with Streamlit, integrating data manipulation techniques using Pandas, ensuring a smooth user experience with dynamic filtering, and basic data visualization using Matplotlib. 

This project complements my overall portfolio by showcasing my ability to integrate data analysis with interactive applications. It goes beyond traditional data wrangling and visualization by allowing users to dynamically explore and filter datasets, and view summaries according to their filtering specifications. This highlights my ability to create practical, interactive tools that make data exploration more accessible.

### üèÖ 2008 Olympic Medalists: Data Analysis üèÖ

<img src="TidyData-Project/Olympic_cover.jpg" alt="Olympics" width="1000">


**TLDR**: An in-depth analysis of the 2008 Olympic medalists, focusing on data cleaning, organization, aggregation, and visualization to uncover key insights about medal distribution across sports and genders.

**Description**: The 2008 Summer Olympics showcased the world's best athletes competing across various sports for gold, silver, and bronze medals. This project involves tidying and analyzing the dataset to extract meaningful insights, such as the most medal-heavy sports, gender-based medal distribution, and the dominance of certain events. The data was first cleaned and transformed into a tidy format, enabling further aggregation and visualization to identify key trends in Olympic medal distribution.

**Skills**: This project involved data cleaning and wrangling, including handling missing values, restructuring wide-format data, and ensuring consistency. Using Pandas, I performed data manipulation, aggregation, and exploratory analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilized for data visualization, highlighting key patterns in medal distribution. 

This project complements my overall portfolio by demonstrating my ability to clean, transform, and analyze complex datasets. It showcases my expertise in data wrangling, aggregation, and visualization to uncover meaningful insights. This highlights my ability to apply analytical techniques to real-world data and effectively communicate findings.

### üé§ Taylor Swift's Lyrical Legacy: Custom NER + Visual Insights üé§

![TSWIFT](NERStreamlitApp/TSNERIMAGE.jpeg)

**TLDR:** An interactive Streamlit app that uses NLP and data visualization to explore Taylor Swift‚Äôs lyrics. Fans can upload lyrics, define custom entity patterns with spaCy‚Äôs EntityRuler, and analyze word counts across albums to uncover trends in her storytelling.

**Description:** Taylor Swift has been telling stories through her lyrics for over 20 years, evolving across genres, eras, and emotions. This project brings her discography to life through data. Using custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy, the app lets users highlight names, places, and motifs in her lyrics. You can define your own entities and visualize them instantly (meant for dark mode users!). On top of that, you can explore word count trends across albums to see how her writing style has grown over time. Whether you‚Äôre a Swiftie or a data nerd (or both!), this app makes lyrical analysis engaging and interactive.

**Skills:** This project highlights my skills in NLP (spaCy), Streamlit app development, and data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. I designed it to be user-friendly, insightful, and fun!

I created this app as a way to combine two things I really love: data science and Taylor Swift. It‚Äôs a playful but meaningful project that fits into my broader portfolio by showing how technical skills can be applied in creative ways. Whether it‚Äôs analyzing text or visualizing trends, I wanted to build something that‚Äôs both technically sound and enjoyable to use.

### ‚òï City Sips: NYC Coffee Sales App ‚òï

![CoffeeShop](StreamlitAppFinal/Images/Coffeeshop.jpg)

**TLDR:** City Sips is an interactive Streamlit app built for coffee shop owners or coffee enthusiasts! The app blends data visualization and machine learning to uncover consumer trends across three different New York store locations. While the data comes from three specific New York locations, the insights are broadly relevant to coffee lovers and business owners across the city

**Description:** New York City is one of the busiest plaes in the world, making coffee a necessity for anyone living or working there! So many coffee shops exist across Manhattan, but the question remains if they are truly optimizing their business strategies. City Sips uses a dataset to draw real-world insights about NYC coffee consumption patterns. By using the sidebar navigation, users can apply their own filters to a variety of visaulziations, offering personalized insights on consumer and product trends. Further, by exploring the page with the linear regression machine learning model, users can upload their own data or use the default NYC data to see what are the most important predictors for maximizing sales. Whether business owners or enthusiasts want to understand which products perform the best, when to restock inventory, or what neighborhoods generate the most traffic, the app offers a platform for brewing more strategic decisions. 

**Skills:** This project showcases my skills in exploratory data analysis, machine learning (specifically, linear regression), and Streamlit app development. My goal was to make an interactive user experience that would create more tailored insights. 

This app complements my overall coding portfolio by showcasing practical, real-world applications of interactive Python development and machine learning model deployment using Streamlit. The app demonstrates my ability to clean and structure data, build regression models, and deploy them in a user-friendly way. It is the perfect blend!
