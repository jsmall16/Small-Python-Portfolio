# ðŸŽ¤ Taylor Swift's Lyrical Legacy: Custom NER + Visual Insights ðŸŽ¤
![TSPIANO](maxresdefault.jpg)

**Calling all Swifties!** This interactive Streamlit combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data visualization to explore the storytelling evolution of one of the greatest lyricists of our time. This app uses spaCy to implement custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) on Taylor Swiftâ€™s lyrics and provides album-based analytics, such as total word counts, to examine lyrical trends.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
This app allows fans and analysts alike to:
- Upload or paste Taylor Swift lyrics
- Define custom entities (e.g., "LOVE_INTEREST", "CITY")
- Visualize entity recognition results using spaCyâ€™s `EntityRuler` and `displacy`
- Analyze word counts across albums with themed visualizations

### Why spaCy?
spaCy is a powerful NLP library that supports customizable NER pipelines. 
- The EntityRuler allowers users to build their own recognition rules and make the analysis more fan-personalized

## App Features 

## Visualize total word count per album

![TSDATA](TSDATA.png)

This bar chart shows the total word count for each of Taylor Swiftâ€™s main studio albums, arranged in chronological order. It highlights how her lyrical volume has evolved over time, with a noticeable peak in Red (Taylorâ€™s Version) and The Tortured Poets Department. Albums like Folklore and Taylor Swift feature more concise writing, while others like 1989 and Midnights strike a balance between depth and brevity. Each bar is color-coded to reflect the aesthetic of its corresponding era, offering both a quantitative and stylistic look at Taylorâ€™s discography.


## Custom Named Entity Recognition 
- Add your own entity labels and keyword patterns (e.g., "James" under "LOVE_INTEREST")
- Upload .txt files or paste in your own lyrics
- Visual output with entities highlighted using spaCyâ€™s displacy.render

An NER (Named Entity Recognition) ruler is especially useful for Swifties because it lets fans tag and track recurring names, places, and motifs across Taylorâ€™s lyrics. By creating custom labels like LOVE_INTEREST, CITY, or SYMBOL, fans can uncover deeper patterns in her storytellingâ€”whether itâ€™s identifying how often she references New York or spotting easter eggs tied to specific eras.

### Example Usage
**1. Define a pattern:**
  - Label: CITY
  - Pattern: LONDON
