    ### Coffee Trends Across NYC Neighborhoods

    This dataset includes over 140,000 coffee shop transactions from multiple store locations across Manhattan.

    Each transaction is tagged with:
    - üó∫Ô∏è A **neighborhood** like SoHo, Midtown, or the Upper West Side  
    - üìÖ A **date and time** of purchase  
    - üßæ A **product category**, type, and unit price  
    - üî¢ The **quantity sold** and store-level revenue

    By analyzing this data, we can uncover which neighborhoods prefer what drinks, when they buy them, and how that affects overall sales performance.
