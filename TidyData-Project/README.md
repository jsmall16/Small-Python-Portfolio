## 📌 Project Overview  
The **2008 Summer Olympics** brought together the world’s top athletes competing in various sports, earning gold, silver, and bronze medals for their performances.  

This project **cleans, organizes, and analyzes** Olympic medalist data to uncover meaningful insights, including:  
- **Which sports had the most medals?**  
- **How were medals distributed between male and female athletes?**  
- **Which gender won the most gold medals in athletics?**  
- **How does the overall medal distribution break down by type?**  

This analysis follows the **Tidy Data Principles** by restructuring the dataset into a more usable format, making it easier for aggregation, visualization, and further analysis.
