Calling all penguin lovers! This **Penguins App** provides a clean and organized way to analyze penguin characteristics while enhancing accessibility and usability. It is the perfect tool for any data scientist or penguin enthusiast!

## Project Overview

This app allows users to filter through a dataset of penguins in an interactive way. Users can view the full dataset and then filter it by selecting a specific penguin species or island from a dropdown menu to display only relevant data. The app also provides data visualizations to make the data-exploration process more accessible to all penguin enthusiasts! 

This app will help users to develop an understanding of: 
- Penguin species distribution
- Species-specific traits
- Habitat insights 


## Dataset Description

This app uses the [Palmer's Penguins Dataset](data/penguins.csv), where each row corresponds to a unique penguin and details their attributes, such as their:

- species
- island
- bill length (mm) 
- bill depth (mm)
- flipper length (mm)
- body mass (g)
- sex
- year

It contains all of the necessary features to prep users for their exploration into the world of penguins!
