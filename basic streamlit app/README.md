Calling all penguin lovers! The Penguins App offers a clear, user-friendly way to explore penguin characteristics, making data analysis more accessible and engaging. It is the perfect tool for any data scientist or penguin enthusiast!

---

## Project Overview

This app allows users to filter through a dataset of penguins in an interactive way. Users can view the full dataset and then filter it by selecting a specific penguin species or island from a dropdown menu to display only relevant data. The app also provides data visualizations to make the data-exploration process more accessible to all penguin enthusiasts! 

This app will help users to develop an understanding of: 
- Penguin species distribution
- Species-specific traits
- Habitat insights

## Dataset Description

Source: [Palmer's Penguins Dataset](data/penguins.csv).

Each row corresponds to a unique penguin and details their attributes, such as their:
- Species
- Island
- Bill length (mm) 
- Bill depth (mm)
- Flipper length (mm)
- Body mass (g)
- Sex
- Year

It contains all of the necessary features to prep users for their exploration into the world of penguins!
